# Better Ingots (like MoreIngots)
This [Subnautica](https://unknownworlds.com/subnautica/) mod adds new ingots to allow you to hoard much more of the raw materials available.  
Every ingot consists of 10 of the original resource compressed into a single item, which can then be unpacked into its constituents when needed.  

## Dependencies
This mod is built for [SMLHelper v2](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/113), and requires that [SMLHelper v2](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/113) and [QModManager](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/201) are installed.  

## MoreIngots
This mod is similar to, and inspired by, the [MoreIngots](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/196) mod. The difference is that the MoreIngots mod does not have prefabs for the custom types, while this mod does not have nearly as many custom types as of now.  
Hence this mod basically just adds slightly better graphics to the original MoreIngots mod. Go check that out if you want even more ingots (and other compact types).  
_Note:_ This mod uses some of the assets from that mod, however, the code is completely different, and the mods are not compatible with each other.

## Recommended Mods
It is stringly recommended that you install [EasyCraft](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/24) and [Radial Tabs](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/207) installed.
